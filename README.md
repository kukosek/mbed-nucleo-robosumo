##Features
###Search tactics
The robot is searching for the oponent by measuring the distance with the ultrasound sensor.
3 moving tactics, that are changed every x seconds if the oponent wasn't found:
⋅⋅* Rotating from one side to the other, the offset is being slowly changed
⋅⋅* Slowly rotating to one side with the right side being as center
⋅⋅* Slowly rotating to one side

###Atack tactic
If the oponent is found, the robot goes straigt. If it detects an encounter with the oponent (by motor encoders), it starts a timer. When the timer reaches x seconds, it twitches, then the timer resets.

##Usage
1.First create an project in [mbed](https://ide.mbed.com/compiler/) 
2.Import the files (Or rewrite the arleady existing files with these) from this repository
3.Edit the pins in main.cpp

##Known issues
⋅⋅* The rate customizing doesn't work like it should
TODOs: Refactoring the code, translating notes to english, encoder motor PID control
